This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the common error of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `bug.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` demonstrates the corrected version.  The error arises from an off-by-one error in the loop that attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds. The solution corrects the loop condition to prevent this.
